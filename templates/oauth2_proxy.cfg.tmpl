# https_address = ":443"

## TLS Settings
# tls_cert_file = "/conf/cert.pem"
# tls_key_file = "/conf/cert.key"

## the OAuth Redirect URL.
# defaults to the "https://" + requested host header + "/oauth2/callback"
redirect_url = "{{getenv "REDIRECT_URL"}}"

## the http url(s) of the upstream endpoint. If multiple, routing is based on path
upstreams = [{{$upstreams := split (getenv "UPSTREAMS") ","}}{{range $index, $upstream := $upstreams}}{{if $index}},{{end}}"{{$upstream}}"{{end}}]

## Log requests to stdout
request_logging = {{getenv "REQUEST_LOGGING"}}

## pass HTTP Basic Auth, X-Forwarded-User and X-Forwarded-Email information to upstream
# pass_basic_auth = true
## pass the request Host Header to upstream
## when disabled the upstream Host is used as the Host Header
# pass_host_header = true 

## Email Domains to allow authentication for (this authorizes any email on this domain)
## for more granular authorization use `authenticated_emails_file`
## To authorize any email addresses use "*"
email_domains = [
    "{{getenv "EMAIL_DOMAINS"}}"
]

provider = "{{getenv "PROVIDER"}}"

## The OAuth Client ID, Secret
client_id = "{{getenv "CLIENT_ID"}}"

## Pass OAuth Access token to upstream via "X-Forwarded-Access-Token"
# pass_access_token = false

## Authenticated Email Addresses File (one email per line)
#authenticated_emails_file = "/conf/emails_allowed"

## Htpasswd File (optional)
## Additionally authenticate against a htpasswd file. Entries must be created with "htpasswd -s" for SHA encryption
## enabling exposes a username/login signin form
# htpasswd_file = ""

## Templates
## optional directory with custom sign_in.html and error.html
# custom_templates_dir = ""

## Cookie Settings
## Name     - the cookie name
## Secret   - the seed string for secure cookies; should be 16, 24, or 32 bytes
##            for use with an AES cipher when cookie_refresh or pass_access_token
##            is set
## Domain   - (optional) cookie domain to force cookies to (ie: .yourcompany.com)
## Expire   - (duration) expire timeframe for cookie
## Refresh  - (duration) refresh the cookie when duration has elapsed after cookie was initially set.
##            Should be less than cookie_expire; set to 0 to disable.
##            On refresh, OAuth token is re-validated. 
##            (ie: 1h means tokens are refreshed on request 1hr+ after it was set)
## Secure   - secure cookies are only sent by the browser of a HTTPS connection (recommended)
## HttpOnly - httponly cookies are not readable by javascript (recommended)
